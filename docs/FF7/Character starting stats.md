## KERNEL.BIN - Section 4: Initialization data

This section of KERNEL.BIN contains the starting stats for the
characters and related game states. On "New Game", this data is copied
directly into the [Savemap][] (from offset 0x0054 to 0x0BAF) which is
explained in the "Menu" section. This data has the same format as the
data explained in that section.
