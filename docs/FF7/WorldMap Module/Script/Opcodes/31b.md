#### Notes

This instruction does absolutely nothing but it is still used for some
reason. Perhaps a feature that was removed, the script suggests it had
one parameter but since it doesn't consume anything that one parameter
would've stayed on the stack forever. This is probably one of the bugs
leading to the [reset stack][] hack.
