-   Opcode: **0x114**
-   Name: push bit from bank0
-   Two-word opcode: Yes

#### Parameters

| Location |  Name   |     Description     |
|:--------:|:-------:|:-------------------:|
|   Code   | Address | Bit address in bank |

#### Notes

Pushes the bit at Address from bank0 (Bank 1 in the [Savemap](../../../Savemap.md). Bit addressing counts the data in the bank as one consecutive bitfield, 0 is the first bit of the first byte, 7 is the last bit of the first byte, 8 is the first bit of the second byte etc.

This is a valid parameter to the [write bank opcode](../../../WorldMap Module/Script/Opcodes/0e0.md).
