-   Opcode: **0x100**
-   Name: reset stack
-   Two-word opcode: No

#### Parameters

| Location | Name | Description |
|:--------:|:----:|:-----------:|

#### Notes

Completely resets the stack. This function was probably introduced to
work around bugs in the script engine, there are some issues that can
cause items on the stack to remain after an instruction has been
executed, otherwise there is no good reason why you would ever need to
clear the stack.
