### Symptoms

During the Bike mini-game the speeds the vehicles travel at are so fast as to be unplayable.

### Causes

Newer and faster machines let it run faster, as there seems to be no speed cap, it travels as fast as it can.

### Solution

A patch that also solves various mini-game related issues was made by dziugo of [Qhimm.com forums](http://forums.qhimm.com/index.php?topic=4554.0)
