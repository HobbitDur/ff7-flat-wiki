## Info

Rail.obj is a file containing key locations of train movement. It stores location on world map, and the train automatically rotates, gives power and calculates needed info (like cargo rotation and etc.) This file **cannot be LZS compressed**. Doing so makes the game not recognize the file.

### File scheme

The file is built the similiar way as [World map WMX.obj](WorldMap wmx.md).

  
  

| Offset           | Length            | Description               |
|------------------|-------------------|---------------------------|
| 0                | Byte              | Count of animation frames |
| 1                | Byte              | Unknown                   |
| 2                | 2 bytes           | Unknown (Padding?)        |
| 4                | UInt32            | Train Stop offset \#1\*   |
| 8                | UInt32            | Train Stop offset \#2\*   |
| 12               | count \* 16 bytes | Animation frames          |
| 12 + (count\*16) | varies            | Padding / 00              |

-   Train stops are offset to animation frames, in which the train stops like (running in the tunnel, or waiting at the station)

### Animation key frame

| Offset | Length           | Description |
|--------|------------------|-------------|
| 0      | 4 Bytes signed\* | X Axis      |
| 4      | 4 Bytes signed\* | Z Axis      |
| 8      | 4 Bytes signed\* | Y Axis      |
| 12     | 4 Bytes          | Unknown     |

-   Location on world map (global) is saved upon 4 bytes. To better understand this (and in fact-operate/hack) just convert it to decimal. Vars are in big-endian.

00 00 FE FF is far west. FF FF 01 00 is far east.
