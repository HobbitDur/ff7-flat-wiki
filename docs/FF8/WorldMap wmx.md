rich research progress on world map file. This wiki page is also based
on Blue's wmx2obj source code.

## General

Wmx.obj is world map geometry model only. Contains 835 segments, does
not contain textures nor additional info like general header or
pointers. Collision is calculated directly from faces. Towns and places
on map are part of world map and are created the same way as mountains,
ground etc. File size is 0x9000\*835. Every 0x9000 a next segments
starts.

Segment = contains 16 blocks

Block = contains geometry

One segment is 0x9000 or 36864 bytes long. There are 16 blocks in a
segment. In theory, a segment can hold 16 blocks which each hold 0x900
bytes of data.

1-768 segments are final world map. 769-835 are story based segments
like Balamb garden stationary, no Esthar, No cities in DISC4.

## Segment

Segment starts with a header (consist offsets for every block). After
segment's header blocks data appears.

  

| Offset | Length   | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| 0      | 68 bytes | Header data |
| 68     | varies   | Block data  |

  

### Header data

| Offset | Length            | Description                                       |
|--------|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| 0      | 4 bytes           | group ID                                          |
| 4      | 64 (16 \* uint32) | Offsets to blocks position. 4 bytes every offset! |

Group ID can be one of theses values:

`0: Trabia`  
`1: Balamb + Fisherman's Horizon`  
`2: Esthar West`  
`3: Esthar South East + Laboratory`  
`4: Mordor + Esthar North`  
`5: Centra`  
`6: Galbadia borders (Deling City, Timber, Dollet, Winhill...)`  
`7: Galbadia middle (GGU, Prison, highlands...)`  
`255: Seas`

## Block explained

Final Fantasy 8's world map is pretty much sea all around. One sea block
or as I like to call it water block is made of 32 polygons, which are
always triangles. The data is pretty straight forward to read with the
above information. One thing to note is, that there is only 1 normal
which points upwards in water block.

In FF8's world data, a segment location is predefined in currently
unknown place (in engine or wmset.obj) and there are horizontally 32 and
vertically 24 segments to form the world map. Each block in segments
follows to same logic with 4x4 grid instead of 32x24. The first block
starts from the upper left corner of the segment.

Each block have their own local bounding box, which the vertice values
follow. A blocks origin is always predefined to start from upper left
corner of its bounding box. This bounding box is always a size of
2048x2048 units (up and down limit is not known). This means that 2048
units or 0x800 is the local max for vertices coordinate before it
overlaps with next blocks bounding box. There are no limitation to
overlapping, you can extend a blocks geometry out of its bounding box
and even out of the local segment. However, the collision is always
calculated from the block which bounding box you are in, so extending a
blocks geometry out of its bounding box doesn't make it collidable in
overlapping block.
