**SETMESSPEED**

#### Description

Sets message speed.

This is only used twice and both in the same place: During the Ragnarok scene right before the dialogue goes to "auto-play" mode and that dreadful song starts. Because it's never called anywhere else, it's safe to assume that it's field-specific. In other words, changing areas "resets" the message speed.
