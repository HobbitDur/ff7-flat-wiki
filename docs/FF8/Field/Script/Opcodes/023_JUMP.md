-   Opcode: **0x023**
-   Short name: **JUMP**
-   Long name: Jump to location

#### Argument

Walkmesh triangle ID.

#### Stack

  
*XCoord*

*YCoord*

*Speed in frames?*

**JUMP**

#### Description

Makes this entity move from its current position to the given coordinates. I'm 99% positive that the last parameter is the speed of the jump. JUMP is only used in three places in the entire game: Twice in Dollet when the two Galbadian soldiers jump off the bridge, and once in Caraway's mansion when Irvine jumps from the chair over the desk.
