-   Short name: **MAPJUMPO**
-   Long name: Map jump

#### Argument

none

#### Stack

  
*Field Map ID*

*Walkmesh ID*

**MAPJUMPO**

#### Description

Jump the player to the field with the given ID and starting on the given walkmesh triangle. The walkmesh is almost always 0 because MAPJUMPO is intended to be used for teleporting the player into a cutscene, and the cutscenes place the characters where they need to be on initialization, so it doesn't matter where they're initially teleported.
