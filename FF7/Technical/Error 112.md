title: Error 112
---

[Home](Main%20Page.md) > [FF7](FF7.md) > [Technical](FF7/Technical.md) > Error 112

### Symptoms

During installation of Final Fantasy VII 'Error 112' is popping,
preventing you from completing the installation.

### Causes

There are two known causes of this problem:

-   You have insufficient disk space (depending on install type you'll
    need at least 260 MB for Standard Install or 460 MB for Maximum
    Install)
-   You have too many files in your Window Temp directory

### Solution

First, check if you have enough space on your hard disk. If not, delete
something :). If the problem still exists, enter your Temp directory
(C:\\Windows\\Temp on Windows 98 or C:\\Documents and
Settings\\\[Profile Name\]\\Local Settings\\Temp on Windows XP) and
delete everything there. This should fix the problem.
